# AEM Third-Party API Integration Using Client Side Rendering Approach

This project demonstrates how to integrate a third-party API with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) using OSGi services and Sling Servlets. Additionally, it outlines an approach for client-side rendering using Angular.
## Prerequisites

- **Java 11**: Ensure that Java 11 is installed on your machine.
- **Maven 3.8.5**: Ensure that Maven 3.8.5 is installed on your machine.
- AEM Author instance running locally.
- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and test the project locally.

### 1. Run AEM Author Instance

Ensure that your AEM Author instance is running on your local machine.

### 2. Build and Install the Project

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following Maven command:

```sh
mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
```
## 3. Create Mock API Data

1. Go to [Mocki.io](https://mocki.io).

2. Create a new mock API URL with the following JSON data:

    ```json
    {
        "medical_providers": [
            {
                "id": 1,

    }
    ```

## 4. Configure the Provider API URL

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr`.

2. Search for "Provider Service Configuration url".

3. Click on the configuration and then click "Edit".

4. Fill in the "Provider API URL" field with the mock API URL you created earlier.

5. Click "Save".


## 5. Test Using Sample Content

To verify that the integration is working correctly, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4502/aem/start.html](http://localhost:4502/aem/start.html).

2. Go to the **Sites** section.

3. Expand the `aem-third-party-api-integration-using-csr` folder.

4. Expand either the **English** or **Spanish** folder, depending on your preference.

5. Select the `PROVIDRS` page.

6. Click **Edit** to open the page editor.

7. In the page editor, click **"Page Information"** on the top left side and select **"View as published"**.

8. You should now be able to see Providers Information on the page.

This will allow you to test the component and verify that it is functioning as expected.

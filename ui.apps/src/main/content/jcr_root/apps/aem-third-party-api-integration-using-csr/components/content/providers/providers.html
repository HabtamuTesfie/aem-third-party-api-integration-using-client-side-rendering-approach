    <h2>Provider List Component</h2>
    <p>This component displays a list of medical providers retrieved from a third-party API. In author mode, this placeholder text provides information about the component's functionality.</p>
    <p>When this component is rendered in publish mode, it fetches and displays the provider details such as name, specialty, facility, contact information, and more. </p>
    <p>Ensure that the API endpoint is correctly configured on the configuration manager (http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr) page.</p>
    <p>Note: This message is only visible in edit mode. In publish mode, when the page is opened using "view as published," the provider information will be visible.</p>
